This is the mosaic application used both for the ISCA16 and SYSTOR16 mentioned above.

The application assumes the tiny images dataset [1] is located in the working directory.
The dataset can be downloaded from "http://horatio.cs.nyu.edu/mit/tiny/data/index.html"

Running the application can be done using the "run" script which creates an immage collage out
of a subset of 2 million images from the tiny image dataset.

Note that this version was only tested using its default parameters. 
Running the application with 10 million images, as was used in the ISCA16 paper, requires
setting the K parameter to 27 and modifying some of the memory allocations.
Also note that this version requires a GPU which supports a larger amount of global memory.

Compilation:
You should install opencv and tbb.
If opencv uses lippivc (check with pkg-config --libs opencv) then remove it from: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc
